# Dyve
An NFT platform that allows users to short NFTs

## Manifesto
To be the backbone of a capital efficient NFT ecosystem for digital and real world private assets

## Problem
NFT markets are broken. Billions of NFTs are being traded with limited tooling and millions are sitting idly, resulting in them being unproductive.

This leads to the current status quo of limited trading strategies and capital inefficient NFT markets

## Solution
Market infrastructure to short NFTs. By introducing an infrastructure that creates a borrower and lender interaction for shorting NFTs, this allows the NFTs in the ecosystem to become more capital efficient

## Progress
A functional POC prototype exists with the timeline of a testnet launch by the end of August and a mainnet launch by EOY.

After numerous feedback from the POC demo, it has revealed a number of potential improvements and feature requests such as:
- **Automated Selling of NFT on the Open Market**: Instead of putting the responsibility of selling the NFT on the open market on the Borrower, the Dyve platform would automate that task and transfer the amount sold to the Borrower
- **Alternative Collateral Currencies**: Instead of just allowing ERC720 currencies to be used as collateral, using other ERC721 NFTs from other collections to be used as collateral instead
- **NFT rental system**: Introduce the functionality to allow users to borrow the NFT for a specified timeframe for a small fee to the Lender

All of these features are currently in development and are expected to be released in the version of the product

## Differentiation
Dyve is the first platform that allows users to Short Sell NFTs with Cross Platform Liquidity, which allows allows lenders to earn yield on their NFTs with no risk of impermanent loss
